  <p>
  Zowe is designed to be an extensible tools platform. You can extend it to meet your needs or distribute the plug-ins to users who have already installed Zowe and want to introduce new functionality to it.</p>

  <p>You can extend Zowe in the following ways:</p>
  <div style="margin-left: 1%">
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0rem">1. Extend the Zowe Command Line Interface.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0rem">2. Add a REST API service to the API Mediation Layer.</p>
  <p>3. Add a plug-in to the Zowe Desktop.</p>
  </div>
