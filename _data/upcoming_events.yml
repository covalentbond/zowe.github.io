    \ Zowe: A User\u2019s Experience from an IT Infrastructure View \u2013 Matheus\
    \ Milani De Oliveira, Gustavo De Paiva Almeida, Guilherme Cartier, IBM \nIBM Services\
    \ presenting the modernization roadmap leveraging ZOWE, zOSMF and OpenSource for\
    \ Mainframe Digital Transformation, in a DEMO-session focused on showing how integration\
    \ of products and solutions is possible, aiming to achive real IT & Business goals\
    \ in a interactive and fun. \n11-11:25 am: 28453 \u2013 Test automation framework\
    \ of your choice powered by Zowe \u2013 Petr Vacula, Broadcom \nMainframe development\
    \ teams sometimes create their own test automation tools to automate repetitive\
    \ testing tasks. Most common reasons to build such tools are that formal test\
    \ automation products do not fit their application\u2019s needs or simply because\
    \ there are no good test automation products available. At the same time, there\
    \ are many test automation frameworks available for non-mainframe testing, many\
    \ of which are open source. What if you could use one of these well established\
    \ and proven testing frameworks to perform mainframe testing? It can be done by\
    \ enabling the test automation framework to perform mainframe actions. Zowe client\
    \ SDK is perfect fit for this duty. \n12-12:25 pm: 28452 \u2013 How to configure\
    \ z/OSMF for Zowe, Rose Sakach, Broadcom \nThe IBM z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF)\
    \ is delivered with z/OS. Though documented as an optional prerequisite for Zowe,\
    \ configuration is highly recommended to fully exploit Zowe\u2019s capabilities.\
    \ Join this session for an overview of first-time configuration tips, a list of\
    \ common problems, and suggestions for trouble-shooting typical issues. \n1-1:25\

    \ Kiryl Branavitski and Viktar Mushtsin, IBA Group \nExplaining how open source\
    \ projects can bring a breath of fresh air to the mainframe world. Inspired by\
    \ ZOWE VS Code extension, we are introducing our vision of how to organize the\
    \ development of zOS applications in the modern IDEs. \n1:30-1:55 pm: 28573 \u2013\
    \ Muscle Memory: New Zowe Desktop Apps for the Multi-tasker \u2013 Sean Grady,\
    \ Rocket Software \nWhere did I save that file? I know I just used that dataset\u2026\

    \ pm: 28479 \u2013 I Get My CICS on Route Zowe! Using Zowe for CICS Development,\
    \ Administration, Automation and More! Joe Winchester and Russell Bonner, IBM\
    \ \nGoogle for CICS development and traditionally you\u2019ll have been be presented\
    \ with ISPF panels and blogs with CEMT, CEDA, and other 4 letter acronyms.\_ This\
    \ talk shows how that doesn\u2019t have to be the case, where Zowe\u2019s command\
    \ line interface and VS Code extensions allow you to become productive with CICS\
    \ using open, simple and familiar interfaces.\_ The presentation will focus on\
    \ how an experienced CICS developer can do their job using the Zowe CLI and VS\
    \ Code extensions including building a devops pipeline in Jenkins and Travis using\
    \ open source technology.\_ The talk will also show how a developer who isn\u2019\
    t a CICS expert can navigate their way around JCL, compilation, deployment using\
    \ scripting and familiar automation tools. \nWednesday, March 17:\n1-1:25 pm:\
    \ 28478 \u2013 Wowee it\u2019s Zowe! Overview and deep dive in how customers,\
    \ ISVS, and the community are using Zowe to transform and modernize the mainframe\
    \ \u2013 Joe Winchester, IBM and Dan Kelosky, Broadcom \nZowe is an open source\
    \ project owned and managed by the Linux Foundation working with a number of software\
    \ vendors.\_ This talk will cover the landscape of Zowe, the community, the technology,\
    \ and its architecture.\_ The focus will be on the deployment scenarios where\
    \ since Zowe\u2019s inception customers have deployed Zowe in their shops, and\
    \ the different users to which they have adopted and been successful with the\
    \ technology.\_ This talk will include co-presenters from customer shops sharing\
    \ their experiences, as well as case studies for where Zowe was a good fit for\
    \ mainframe devops or automation modernization.\_ The landscape of Zowe covers\
    \ vendor offerings as well as runtimes such as CICS, DB2, IMS, MQ and more, so\
    \ this talk has applicability across the diversity of what the mainframe can offer.\
    \ \n1:30-1:55 pm: 28578 \u2013 How to get Involved in the Zowe Community for fun,\
    \ education, contribution or commercial extensions \u2013 Bruce Armstrong, IBM\
    \ \nCome learn the many ways you or your organization can get involved in the\
    \ Zowe open community. The community is so much more than just open source code\
    \ \u2013 it is the people and teams working together to improve the z/OS experience.\
    \ We will cover how the community is organized, ways for you to interact with\
    \ community members and key meetings to get your ideas, issues and requirements\
    \ known. Zowe is a multifaceted project consisting of both open source but, almost\
    \ more importantly, a set of executable services with open interfaces for download\
    \ and immediate use. Bring your questions on how to get started and we will provide\
    \ answers. The integrated components of Zowe can be used together or you can deploy\
    \ selected components of Zowe for their specific capabilities. We will discuss\
    \ deployment options. Come join the Zowe movement!!! Zowe is a project of the\
    \ Open Mainframe Project. Zowe\u2122 and the Open Mainframe Project\u2122 are\
    \ trademarks of the Linux Foundation. \n2-2:25 pm: 28455 \u2013 Build z/OS-connected\
    \ apps using Node.js, Python or Swift Zowe SDKs, Andrew Harn and Michael Bauer,\
    \ Broadcom \nThe Zowe CLI Squad has recently introduced Software Development Kits\
    \ (SDKs) for Node.js, Python, and Swift. These SDKs enable developers to integrate\
    \ some of the most used Zowe CLI functions into their own projects with minimal\
    \ development overhead. In this session, we will briefly describe how the Zowe\
    \ CLI and the Zowe Explorer VS Code Extension utilize he Zowe Client Node SDK,\
    \ what these SDKs have to offer, and explain how to get started with your own\
    \ z/OS-connected project using your (Node, Python, or Swift) SDK-of-choice! We\
    \ will also be interested to hear which languages you would like us to develop\
    \ for next! \n3-3:25 pm: 28539 \u2013 Proposed ZOWE Incubator \u2013 ZEBRA \u2013\
    \ Yongkim (Alex) Kim, Vicom Infinity \nZEBRA(Zowe Embedded Browser for RMF/SMF\
    \ and APIs) is a proposed incubator project for Linux Foundation\u2019s Open Mainframe\
    \ ZOWE Project. It intends to provide re-usable and industry compliant JSON formatted\
    \ RMF/SMF data records, so that many other ISV SW and users can exploit them using\
    \ Open-Source SW for many ways. It can serve applications using JSON formatted\
    \ RMF data thru ZOWE managed APIs to share/re-use them. It has potential to help\
    \ system programmers, capacity/performance analyzers use more open-source utilities\
    \ out there, perhaps create knowledge base to share among z performance SMEs and\
    \ users. \n3:30-3:55 pm: 28543 \u2013 Access z/OS Performance & Management Data\
    \ using Zowe CLI and CA SYSVIEW \u2013 Michael Heuzey, Broadcom \nZowe and the\
    \ Open Mainframe Project are helping mainframers everywhere access their z/OS\
    \ data and services in new and innovative ways. No longer are you bound to the\
    \ green screen in order to interact with the mainframe. The new SYSVIEW for Zowe\
    \ CLI plug-in is the latest way to utilize Zowe to view your mainframe systems\
    \ and transactions off-platform.\nDiscover how you can harness Zowe and CA SYSVIEW\
    \ to improve and streamline devops processes. Use cases include help desk ticket\
    \ creation and CI/CD pipelines. \nRegister for the event at their website: https://event.share.org/register.\
