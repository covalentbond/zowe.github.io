# Welcome to Zowe website development

This GitHub repo is for management of the Zowe website. It uses [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to automatically publish any commits to the master branch of the repo to https://zowe.org. GitHub Pages uses  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to publish this site from the content in your markdown files in this repo. For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Site organization

Most site updates can be made without changing the markdown files, but adjusting the [config settings](_config.yml). This includes doing new releases and changing the URLs to other resources.

The primary page content is in [index.md](index.md). The overall layout is in [_layouts/default.html](_layouts/default.html), and css and image files are in [assets](assets).

### Doing a new release

To do a new release, add a new entry at the top of [releases.yml](_data/releases.yml) right under the contents with this structure:

```yaml
- version: 1.4.0 # version number
  release_notes: https://zowe.github.io/docs-site/latest/getting-started/summaryofchanges.html#version-1-4-0-august-2019 # link to release notes
  release_date: 2019-08-09 # release date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  documentation: latest # path to docs ( minus the site url of https://docs.zowe.org )
```
### Add an announcement

To add an announcement, add an entry like below in [announcements.yml](_data/announcements.yml):

```yaml
- announcement: This is my announcement
  link: https://linktomyannouncementcalltoaction.org
```

### Add upcoming events

Events are not supposed to be added/modified manually, since they directly get synced with the [OMP events calendar](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/events/category/zowe) and updates only when the response of [ICS feed](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/events/category/zowe?ical=1&tribe_display=photo) changes through a PR by GitHub action.

The events are dynamically fetched from an [ICS feed](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/events/category/zowe?ical=1&tribe_display=photo) and parsed into the [upcoming_events.yml](_data/upcoming_events.yml).

If needed, the [upcoming_events.yml](_data/upcoming_events.yml) can be manually updated by running `python assets/script/ics-to-yml.py` locally from root directory.

## Submitting site updates

Any site updates can be submitted as a pull request. We recommmend you [create a fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) of this repo and make changes there so you can preview them using GitHub Pages on your GitHub account. You can also develop locally with the following steps:
